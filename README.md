# Seg2Map :mag_right: :milky_way:

*An interactive web map app for geospatial label imagery generated within the Doodleverse*

Seg2Map will take label imagery in geospatial label imagery from [s2m_engine](https://github.com/Doodleverse/s2m_engine) and

* Display the imagery on a web map
* Provide simple tools to interact with those label images

Tentative roadmap:
- Notebook to 
  - read in GeoTiff and display on a web map made using ipyleaflet
  - provide tools to smooth label data, such as at boundaries
  - provide tools to delete label data
- Notebook to
  - generate or edit label images for certain tiles using HoloDoodler code
